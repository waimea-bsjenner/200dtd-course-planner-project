# Relevant Implications

## Usability Implications

The end-product must be usable, following common usability heuristics and allowing for easy use

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant because an end-product that is hard to understand and difficult to easily use is bad

### Impact / Considerations

I will have to consider the button placements, colors, and different page navigation.



## Functionality implications

The end-product will be functional, meaning it can achieve the tasks expected of it.

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant because an end-product that has bugs and barely works is bad

### Impact / Considerations

I will have to consider the database connections, form connections, and that there are no dead ends



## Aesthetic implications

The end-product will be aestheticly pleasing, and not the child of a light show and flashbang

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant because an end-product that looks like someone ate a unicorn and proceeded to throw up all over the pages would be bad

### Impact / Considerations

I will have to consider color, images, fonts, etc



## End-User implications

The end-product will meet the user's specific needs

### Relevance to the System

This implication is relevant because an end-product that was designed without feedback from an end-user will likely be unsatisfactory and very different from expectations

### Impact / Considerations

I will have to consider any feedback from my end-user as I develop the product, and alter the design accordingly
